== TODOs

* "all" -> "All", "profile" -> "Profile"
* "You haven't submit any solution" -> "You haven't submitted any solutions"
* Make profile page thinner: middle pane should be only col-md-6
* Should the sidebar be a dropdown menu like for the assignments?
* Regenerate key dialog should close the modal on success.
* Fixed-width font for side menu like the top menu
* Remove red background from Logout... maybe light blue?
* I'd put "Your Submit Token:", the token, and the regenerate button on the same line.
* Clarify that the public key there is something that students need to add to their repository.
* Don't open top links in a separate window.
